Codecademy CS101 terminal project - my version of the popular wordle game

Welcome to wordl-ish! The poor man's, terminal based, Wordle!
The rules are simple:
1. Guess a 5 letter word from the english language (no plurals)
2. wordl-ish will colour-code the letters of your guess based on their correctness -
      - Green:  correct!
      - Yellow: the letter exists but is in the wrong place
      - Red:    the letter is not anywhere in the word
3. Use these codes to help you with your next guess! You get 6 tries.
4. ????
5. Profit!
